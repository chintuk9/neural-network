Neural Network based Strategy
In this project has following topics:
    Feature Engineering
    Neural Network Creation
    Strategy Backtesting
In addition, We'll use popular technical indicators to build features. They are as follows:

    Bollinger Bands
    Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
    Parabolic Stop And Reverse (SAR)

The discussion about what these technical indicators and how they are built, is out of scope of this session. We'll use TA-LIB library to build these indicators
